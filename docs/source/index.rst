Berkeley AUTOLAB's GQCNN Package
================================

Overview
--------
The `gqcnn` package is a Python API for training and deploying `Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Networks (GQ-CNNs)`_ for grasp planning using training datasets from the `Dexterity Network (Dex-Net)`_, developed by the `Berkeley AUTOLAB`_ and introduced in the `Dex-Net 2.0 paper`_.

.. note:: We're excited to announce **version 1.0**, which brings the GQ-CNN package up to date with recent research in `Dex-Net`_.
   Version 1.0 introduces support for:

   #. **Dex-Net 4.0:** Composite policies that decide whether to use a suction cup or parallel-jaw gripper.
   #. **Fully Convolutional GQ-CNNs:** Fully convolutional architectures that efficiently evaluate millions of grasps faster than prior GQ-CNNs.

Project Goals
-------------
The goals of this project are to facilitate:

#. **Replicability** of GQ-CNN training and deployment from:
    #. The latest `Dex-Net 4.0`_ results.
    #. Older results such as `Dex-Net 2.0`_, `Dex-Net 2.1`_ and `Dex-Net 3.0`_.
    #. Experimental results such as `FC-GQ-CNN`_.
#. **Research extensions** on novel GQ-CNN architectures that have higher performance on `Dex-Net 4.0`_ training datasets.

.. _Dex-Net 2.1: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/#dexnet_21
.. _Dex-Net 3.0: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/#dexnet_3
.. _Dex-Net 4.0: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/#dexnet_4
.. _FC-GQ-CNN: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/fcgqcnn

Our longer-term goal is to encourage development of robust GQ-CNNs that can be used to plan grasps on different hardware setups with different robots and cameras.

Disclaimer
----------
GQ-CNN models are sensitive to the following parameters used during dataset generation:
   #. The robot gripper
   #. The depth camera
   #. The distance between the camera and workspace.

As a result, we cannot guarantee performance of our pre-trained models on other physical setups. If you have a specific use-case in mind, please reach out to us. It might be possible to generate a custom dataset for you particular setup. We are actively researching how to generate more robust datasets that can generalize across robots, cameras, and viewpoints.

Development
-----------
The package is currently under active development. Please raise all bugs, feature requests, and other issues under the `Github Issues`_.
For other questions or concerns, please contact Jeff Mahler (jmahler@berkeley.edu) or Vishal Satish (vsatish@berkeley.edu) with the subject line starting with "GQ-CNN Development".
