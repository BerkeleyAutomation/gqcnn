Grasp Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Grasp planning involves searching for the grasp with the highest predicted probability of success given a point cloud.
In the `gqcnn` package this is implemented as a policy that maps an RGBD (color + depth) image to a 6-DOF grasping pose by maximizing the output of a GQ-CNN with the `Cross Entropy Method`_. 
For details, see our `ICRA 2017 workshop abstract`_.

This part of the tutorial walks through the script `policy.py`_ which is included in the `gqcnn` repository under examples/.
The corresponding template configuration file is `cfg/examples/policy.yaml`.

.. _Cross Entropy Method: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy_method
.. _ICRA 2017 workshop abstract: https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dex-net/raw/gh-pages/docs/dexnet_icra2017_lecom_workshop_abstract.pdf
.. _policy.py: https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/gqcnn/blob/dev_jeff/examples/policy.py

Edit the Configuration File
---------------------------

First, update the parameters of your configuration file (ex. `policy.yaml`) to point to a GQ-CNN model::

	policy:
	  gqcnn_model: /path/to/your/model/

For example, this could be the path to the model trained in the previous example (e.g. `/home/user/Data/models/grasp_quality/model_ewlohgukns`)

Run the Example Python Script
-----------------------------
From a new terminal run the following out of the root of your `gqcnn` repo::

	python examples/policy.py --config-filename /path/to/your/policy/configuration

You should see a sequence of images similar to these:
                        
.. image:: ../images/cem.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 800 px
   :scale: 100 %
   :align: center

The final planned grasp will be overlayed on the original color and depth images

.. image:: ../images/policy_final_grasp.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 800 px
   :scale: 100 %
   :align: center

You can also try out grasp planning on multiple objects by changing the input data directory in the configuration file::

	sensor:
	  image_dir: data/rgbd/multiple_objects

ROS Package
-----------
We are currently developing a ROS service that can be used to plan grasps from RGBD images using GQ-CNNs.
We plan to release the ROS package by June 28, 2017.
